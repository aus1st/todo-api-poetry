Lifespan Events
You can define logic (code) that should be executed before the application starts up. This means that this code will be executed once, before the application starts receiving requests.

The same way, you can define logic (code) that should be executed when the application is shutting down. In this case, this code will be executed once, after having handled possibly many requests.

Because this code is executed before the application starts taking requests, and right after it finishes handling requests, it covers the whole application lifespan (the word "lifespan" will be important in a second ðŸ˜‰).

This can be very useful for setting up resources that you need to use for the whole app, and that are shared among requests, and/or that you need to clean up afterwards. For example, a database connection pool, or loading a shared machine learning model.
